# Description 

This is a Capstone project for CMU where we developed an sgent based simulation model to understand how information flows in a network so as to:

- Populate a message in the most efficient way
- Reach certain groups of people most effectively
- Find sources of false information
- Decrease the chance of misunderstanding in communication

The final deliverable is a simulation prototype that:
- Allows the user to specify simulation parameters;
- Gives the result of simulation in the same format as the input file;
- Present simple visualization of the result network
